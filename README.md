    17.Introduction to virtual Functions
    18.Diamond Problem
    19.Deep copy(The other copy would be created) and shallow copy(copy through  location)
    

    ***************** OOP Pillars *******************************************
    Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming 
    1.Abstraction
    2.Encapsulation
    3.Polymorphism 
         3.1 Runtime PolyMorphism
         3.2 Compile Time PolyMorphism
    4.Inheritance
         4.1 Single Inheritance
         4.2 Multiple Inheritance 
         4.3 Hierarchical Inheritance
         4.4 Hybrid Inheritance
         4.5 Multilevel Inheritance
         4.6 Polymorphism in c++

   -- Function Overloading in c++
    1. Function That can't be Overloaded
    2. Function overload and Const Keyword
    3. Function Overloading and Return Type
    4. Overloading with Inheritance


   --Virtual Function


    - key points
     -Multiple inheritance is supported in c++ not supported in java
     - due to multiple inheritance the concept of ambguity arised which can be solved using scope ressolution operator 
       while in java the concept of interfaces arised.
     - in c++ for the run time polymorphism the virtual method wold be used while in java the concept of abstract class and 
       abstarct method would be used.
     - The friend function is only supported in c++ Not supported in java
     - In java the access modifiers are public, private , protected , package private 
       In c++ the access modifiers are public ,private , protected .
     - Java employes automatic collection where JVM (java Virtual Machine) that automatically manages the memory, objects that are no longer in use.
       C++ offers the smart manual memory management  using the pointer.
